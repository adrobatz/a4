My Wedding Website

I'm getting married soon(ish) and all anyone can talk about with me is wedding planning, so I thought I'd channel that energy into something productive!

Hoepfully the app is fairly straight forward, here is a basic outline:

There are 2 sections, one for guests to RSVP and the other for the Couple to manage the RSVP list. 

Guests:
Guests can respond to the RSVP and subsequently make edits if necessary

Couple:
The couple cannot make changes to the guests responses, however they can add categories to keep track of the groups of guests for later organization.

**my tags are not reflecting correctly on the page (they're showing the most recent update rather than the tags that correspond with the RSVP)
